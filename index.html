    <p>I'm Nelson Liang, a sophomore at Rochester Insitute of Technology studying computer science and minoring in
        Economics and Mobile Development. I'm interested in financial engineering, personal finance, and technology.
        I'm also currently looking for a coop or internship for Summer 2020 or Fall 2020.</p>
    <p>
        This site is meant to serve as a personal website as well as provide me with some experience in web development.
        I'm hoping friends, family and potential employers will visit this site in order to learn more about me.
